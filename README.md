# Etch-a-Sketch

Submission for The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Used JavaScript (and HTML and CSS) to create an Etch-a-Sketch.

The squares are colored with random bright colors when your cursor moves over them. On link open, a prompt is given to specify the number of squares. If opened in a new tab, this prompt is sometimes not shown, so the size is defaulted to 16x16. Click New Grid to specify a new desired size. The size of each square scales based on your window size. Enjoy!
